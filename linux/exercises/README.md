Exercises and Practice

This directory contains hands-on exercises designed to reinforce Linux concepts covered in this repository.

The goal of these exercises is not speed or memorization,
but applying commands in realistic scenarios and understanding their effects.

Each exercise focuses on:
- a clear objective
- practical command usage
- observation of system behavior

These challenges reflect common tasks encountered in real Linux environments.
