# Linux Core Skills

This repository documents my hands-on practice of Linux fundamentals with a focus on terminal usage, permissions, process monitoring, text processing, and package management.

The goal of this repository is to build a solid and practical Linux foundation, especially relevant for security, system analysis, and technical problem-solving environments.

## Skills Covered

- File system navigation and terminal usage
- File permissions and ownership (chmod, chown)
- Text processing and filtering (cat, less, head, tail, grep)
- Process monitoring and management (ps, top)
- Package installation and management using apt
- Basic log inspection and real-world command usage

## Approach

Each directory focuses on a specific Linux concept and contains:
- A short explanation of the topic
- Practical command examples
- Notes from hands-on usage
- Simple scenarios related to real system behavior

The exercises section documents applied practice rather than theoretical summaries.

## Purpose

This repository is part of my long-term learning path toward security-focused system understanding, where Linux is treated as a working environment rather than a collection of commands.
