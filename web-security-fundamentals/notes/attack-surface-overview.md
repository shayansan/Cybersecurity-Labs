Attack Surface Overview

What attack surface means:
All inputs an application accepts.

Typical surfaces:
- URL parameters
- Headers
- Cookies
- Request body
- File uploads

Attacker mindset:
Every input is a question to the server.

Security insight:
The larger the surface, the higher the probability of mistakes.

Personal note:
Mapping inputs is more important than testing payloads early on.
