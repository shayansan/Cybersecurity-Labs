IBSS is a Wi-Fi mode where devices connect directly to each other without using an access point.
In IBSS, all devices are equal, there is no central controller like an AP, and one of the devices creates the wireless network while others join it. This is often called ad-hoc mode.

IBSS is rarely used today because it does not scale well, has limited security features compared to modern Wi-Fi networks, and is not suitable for enterprise or managed environments.

SSID is simply the name of the Wi-Fi network that users see and connect to.
When you open Wi-Fi settings on your phone or laptop and see names like “Home_WiFi” or “Campus_Network”, those names are SSIDs.

BSSID is the unique identifier of a specific access point inside a Wi-Fi network.
Technically, the BSSID is the MAC address of the wireless interface on the access point.
Even if several access points broadcast the same SSID, each one has a different BSSID so devices can tell them apart.

when you have a lot of access points in a place and you want to keep your communication with access points you have to form ESSID that keeps your devices on the network and doesn’t need change manually.

A captive portal is a network access system that forces users to see a login or agreement page before they can access the internet or internal network.

You usually see captive portals in places like hotels, airports, cafés, universities, and guest Wi-Fi networks.

Captive portals are mainly used for access control and tracking.
They help organizations control who is using the network, separate guest users from internal users, show legal terms, and sometimes log user activity for compliance.

security note:
Captive portals do not encrypt traffic by themselves, so they should always be used together with HTTPS and proper Wi-Fi encryption like WPA2 or WPA3.

A directional antenna focuses the wireless signal in one main direction instead of spreading it everywhere.
Because the energy is concentrated, the signal can travel farther and be stronger in that specific direction.

An omnidirectional antenna radiates the signal in all directions around it, usually in a 360-degree horizontal pattern.
This makes it suitable for environments where clients are spread around the access point, such as offices, homes, classrooms, and public Wi-Fi areas.

Wireless mesh is a wireless network design where multiple access points or nodes connect to each other wirelessly and work together as one network instead of relying on a single central access point.

In a wireless mesh, each node can communicate with nearby nodes and forward traffic for others, so data can travel through multiple paths to reach its destination.
