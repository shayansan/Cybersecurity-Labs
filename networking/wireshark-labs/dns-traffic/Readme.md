Title
DNS Traffic Analysis using Wireshark

Goal
To observe how domain names are resolved to IP addresses by analyzing DNS traffic.

Tools
- Wireshark
- nslookup / dig
- Web browser

Scenario
A DNS query was generated by requesting the domain example.com while capturing network traffic.

Observation
DNS packets were observed in the capture, including a standard query and a corresponding response.
The query packet requested an A record for the domain name, and the response returned the associated IP address.

Analysis
The DNS query contains the domain name in plaintext, along with the query type (A record).
The response packet includes the resolved IP address and a Time To Live (TTL) value, which indicates how long the result can be cached.

Both the query and response are visible in plain text, meaning DNS traffic can be monitored by anyone on the same network.

Result
- DNS query and response successfully captured
- Domain name visible in plaintext
- IP address returned by DNS server
- TTL value observed in the response

What I learned
- DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses
- DNS traffic is not encrypted by default
- Domain names can be monitored through DNS traffic
- DNS is a critical dependency for almost all network communication
