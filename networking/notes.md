# network notes for cyber
part 1-OSI model
this model has 7 layers that we can call with this all people seem to need data processing
7=>application
6=>presentation
5=>session
4=>transportation
3=>network
2=>data link
1=>physical

layer 1=> layer that contain physical things such as fiber, cables and everything that exists in the real world.

layer 2=>handles local LAN communication by sending frames using MAC addresses through switches, enabling features like ARP and VLANs

layer3=> this layer specially uses routers and IP address to traverse in different network and totally everything about subnet mask and routing and IP problems are about this layer.

layer4=>this layer has duty to transport information during the network and use TCP and UDP protocols.

layer 5=> for sending information from one part of network to the other part we need an active session to can do this and this provides a management between devices.

layer 6=> that get data from the network and do something like character encoding and application encryption and ….. this layer combined with the next layer

layer 7=> the layer that we can see what happening in it and has some protocols like HTTPS and….

part2- network devices
router=> A router connects different networks and decides where packets should go next (routing)

switch:
A switch connects devices in the same network:
• PC ↔ PC
• PC ↔ Server
• Printer ↔ Laptop
The switch uses MAC addresses to forward frames.

What it uses internally
✅ MAC Address Table (CAM table)

Firewall (The Main Security Gate)
What it does
A firewall decides:
✅ allow traffic
❌ block traffic
Based on rules مثل:
• Source IP
• Destination IP
• Port (80, 443, 22…)
• Protocol (TCP/UDP)
• Application signatures (next-gen firewalls)

Types of firewalls

Packet filtering firewall (basic)
Checks IP/port/protocol.

Stateful firewall (stronger)
Understands “connections” (session tracking).

Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)
Understands apps like:
• YouTube
• Telegram
• BitTorrent
• VPN traffic

IDS and IPS (Intrusion Detection / Prevention)
IDS (Detection only)
It watches traffic and alerts:
🚨 “This looks like an attack”
Example:
• brute force attempts
• port scanning
• malware signatures
✅ It does NOT block automatically.

IPS (Prevention)
Like IDS but it can:
❌ block malicious traffic instantly

✅ Security relevance
They help detect:
• exploit attempts
• known malware behavior
• suspicious payload patterns

⚠️ Common issue:
False positives → may block real users if configured badly.

Load Balancer (Traffic Distributor)
What it does
Load balancer distributes incoming traffic to multiple servers:
• Server1
• Server2
• Server3
Used in:
• big websites
• cloud systems

Proxy (Middle Man for Web Traffic)
What it does
A proxy sits between user and internet:
User → Proxy → Website
It can:
• hide user IP
• log browsing
• filter websites
• scan downloads

Proxy types
• Forward proxy (used by users)
• Reverse proxy (protects servers)

NAS (Network Attached Storage) 🗄️🌐
NAS = storage shared over a network like a file server.
• Works at file-level (shared folders)
• Uses protocols like SMB/CIFS (Windows), NFS (Linux)
• Easy to set up, common in homes/companies
✅ Best for: file sharing, backups, media storage

SAN (Storage Area Network) ⚡🧱
SAN = high-performance storage network for servers.
• Works at block-level (looks like a raw disk to servers)
• Uses Fibre Channel or iSCSI
• Faster, more complex, used in data centers
• Best for: databases, virtualization (VMware), enterprise systems

A Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) is a central device/system used in companies to manage many Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) from one place 📡🧠

What it does (main functions)
• Controls and configures APs centrally (SSID, passwords, channels, power)
• Manages roaming (when you move, your device switches APs smoothly)
• Applies security policies (WPA2/WPA3, 802.1X authentication)
• Monitors users and AP health (who is connected, signal quality)
• Handles guest Wi-Fi portals (captive portal / login pages)

Access Point (AP) — a little more
An Access Point is a device that gives Wi-Fi access to a network.
It basically acts like a wireless bridge:
Wi-Fi devices (phones/laptops) ↔ wired network (switch/router)

What an AP does:
• Creates a Wi-Fi network (SSID)
• Connects wireless users to the LAN
• Handles wireless security like WPA2/WPA3
• Manages multiple clients at once
📌 In companies, APs are everywhere because they cover a whole building.

Difference between an Access Point and a Modem (Very important)

Modem
Modem = connects you to the ISP (the internet provider).
• It brings internet into your home/company.
• Without a modem, you usually cannot access the internet at all.

Modem connects:
Your network ↔ ISP network

Access Point (AP)
AP = gives Wi-Fi connection inside your local network.
• It does NOT create internet by itself.
• It just lets devices join the network wirelessly.

AP connects:
Wireless devices ↔ your local network

part 3 network fundamentals
content delivery network(CDN): it uses to transfer data in this part of the world to another part of the world and it’s graphically distributed.

VPN: secure private data traversing a public network and It has ability to encrypt and decrypt data during the traverse and it sometimes has firewall.

quality of service  this list has duty to prioritize something to other thing to send or keep or … in the network and it uses traffic shaping and packet shaping and you change things in its list in routers or modems.

time to live (TTL) this is important because we have to manage time that something have to do and we use this to close and stop a work if this time ends.
for example, sometimes routers looping happens that means router A thinks next router B is next and router B thinks that router A is next and it goes over and over. so in this case TTL will stop this loop after its time ends.

and here IP protocol has special rule because after any pass from router IP address decrease the number of TTL, and this number is 64 for Linux and MAC and 128 for WINDOWS.

DNS (Domain Name System)
Converts:
google.com → IP address

in routers TTL is with hop but in DNS TTL is with second.

part 4cloud models
we have 3 types of deployment models :
1- public  for everyone over the internet
2- private  your own virtualized local data center
3- hybrid  a mix of public and private

one type is software as a server : SaaS means you use a software application through the internet, and the provider hosts and manages everything for you (servers, updates, storage, availability).
You usually access it by:
• a web browser
• a mobile app

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): you rent virtual machines + networking, and you manage the OS, updates, and installed software.

PaaS (Platform as a Service): you deploy your application code, and the provider manages the servers, OS, runtime, and scaling.

Main difference: IaaS = you manage more, PaaS = provider manages more.

if we want to manage services based on which one is more on provider management it will be like this: SaaS  PaaSlaaS

part 5 : introduction to IP
